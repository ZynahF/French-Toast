1 Make the egg mixture: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and cinnamon. Stir in the orange zest and/or Triple Sec if using. Whisk the mixture until well blended and pour into a shallow bowl, wide enough to place a slice of the bread you will be using.

2 Soak bread slices in egg mixture: Place each slice of bread into the milk egg mixture, allowing the bread to soak in some of it.

3 Fry the french toast: Melt some butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Shake off the excess egg mixture from the bread, and place the bread slices onto the hot skillet. Fry the French toast until browned on one side, then flip and brown the other side.

4 Serve hot with butter, maple syrup, and if available, fresh berries.
